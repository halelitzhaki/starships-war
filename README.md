## My Updates

The latest version of Starships War includes the following enhancements:

1. **Shield Power-Up**: Players can now collect a shield power-up that activates a protective circle around the starship, absorbing incoming damage. This shield remains active for 5 seconds before fading.

2. **Blackhole Level**: Introducing a new level featuring a black hole that absorbs everything it touches, adding a new layer of challenge and excitement to the gameplay.
